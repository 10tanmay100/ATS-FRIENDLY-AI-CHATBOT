RAG Chatbot for Healthcare Client  
Objective: Develop solutions for Healthcare Client. We need to take documents from them related to 
medical things and we had to make sure that all such complex scenarios such as table, diagrams, 
flowcharts understanding must get captured.  
Resolution: Implemented Advance RAG Techniques to build the complete chatbot.   
Skills & Tools: Generative AI, Llama Models, Langchain  
Table Comparison Tool using Python and ML  
Objective: Worked for PWC’s onsite Healthcare client for building some solutions using Python and 
Machine Learning.  I implemented an internal tool from scratch using python where they had different 
kinds of tables and they wanted to match columns based on column nam es as well as values in that 
specific columns as there are many cases where detecting only columns could not help us  
Resolution: Implemented different similarity techniques as well as hypothesis testing. Implemented 
Regular Expressions also for some situations as well as , used BERT models to get some data patterns too.  
Skills & Tools: Statistical Methods, NLP , Machine Learning  
Advanced Driver Assistant System (ADAS)   Objective: Develop solutions for vehicular perception through inertial sensor signals. I need to predict few 
features include transient events in the form of anomalies and obstacles, such as potholes, cracks, speed 
bumps, etc.; and persistent events, such as surface type, conservation condition, and the road surface 
quality. data were produced with contextual variations including three different vehicles, driven by three 
different drivers, traveling through three different environments. To recognize and cla ssify the vehicular 
perception pattern   
Resolution: Classification algorithm used I have tried few such as Naïve Bayes, Random Forest as well as 
Logistic Regression. I tuned each and every one and I got Random Forest as better one with 89% f1 score 
value. Dataset was imbalanced so I applied SMOTE to handle such issues. I have incorporated GitHub 
actions for Continuous Integration and Delivery and Deployment.   
Skills & Tools: EDA and Classification algorithms. MLFLOW for tracking the model and artifacts, Docker for 
containerize codes.

Object Detection and Tracking System for Sport Client  
Objective: Develop a PoC using computer vision where we will have to track player whoever wil be with 
the football and we need to detect what event occurs on what time. Events were as follows Shot, 
Dribbling, Pass, Tackle. Provided 100+GB of High Quality Football mat ch video.  Helping annotators to do 
the annotation in faster manner.  
Resolution: Implemented YOLOv8 model for detection as well as for Tracking. We had to do different 
image preprocessing using Opencv to make that detection accurate. I achieved 75% MAPE  
Skills & Tools: Computer Vision, YOLO, Opencv

• End to End HealthCare Analytics(AWS Sagemaker , Snowflake)   
Worked for a Healthcare client, expected from us to build a complete MLOPS pipeline where they 
can do their predictions in real time. Data source was fetched and some basic feature engineering 
task was done by snowflake and after that I have implemented th e Sagemaker pipeline to build 
the mlops lifecycle along with the model retraining approach.   
• End to End Object Detection Solution (Aws Sagemaker, Resnet)   
Data Annotation client came to us and I have built an end to end object detection automated 
workflow using AWS built -in Resnet object detector algorithm.   
• Serverless Deployment Using AWS Fargate POC    
I have built a solution using machine learning and I deployed that on AWS Fargate to achieve 
serverless deployment along with load balancer   
• End to End MLOPS Project for Loan Approval System (RDS, AWS Sagemaker)    
Worked on a machine learning POC where we have built an end to end pipeline in AWS   
Sagemaker where we had to build an automated loan approval system where from data collection 
till deployment was completely automated. I have incorporated RDS as data storage and from 
there I have built the solution. I have added model retraining approach where we can add our 
own hyperparameters and we can retrain and deployment will happen automatically based on the 
accuracy metrics.
